# Literacy and Membership

Literacy, as defined in this project and by Gee, is the mastery or degree to which one is an effective member of a Discourse community.

The most highly literate members will be adherent and conform to the expectations of the community in terms of:

- Saying
- Doing
- Being
- Valuing and believing

According to Gee, Discourse membership is binary: you are either in the Discourse or you are not, and may be a "pretender."

In the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]], literacy is demonstrated by practices like:

- Using and understanding [[Linking and Association]] and [[Obsidian Graph View]]
- Valuing [[Local-First Data Ownership]]
- Participating in [[Plugin Development and Customization]]
