# Obsidian Discourse Community

Obsidian’s community has an unusual level of dedication and loyalty. This suggests that it’s not just what tool they use, but who they are.

In this community, Discourse doesn’t always happen through text. When a user uploads a plugin in Obsidian, they are performing all three criteria of language: saying, doing and being (James Gee).

- They are saying that they believe their plugin fixes some gap in the program’s capabilities.
- They are doing something to solve that problem.
- They are being a considerate member of the community.

An entire Discourse community has formed around striving for the best possible experience. The collection of developers and advanced users closely matches John Swales’ definition of a group with a "potentially discoverable set of common public goals," the primary being the creation of a highly scalable note-taking storage system.

The community also has a specified lexis, especially when communicating through plugin solutions, since the message could be entirely in code.

Obsidian as a platform facilitates [[Association as Meaning-Making]], which helps the Discourse community make meaning together.
