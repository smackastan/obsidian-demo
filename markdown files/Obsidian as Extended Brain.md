# Obsidian as Extended Brain

Obsidian has a stricter and smaller [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] defined by its mythos of the **extended brain hypothesis** (Downs).

This is the idea that the brain reaches outside of the skull and into the environment. A simple example is counting on our fingers: our fingers function as additional memory that free up resources in the brain, allowing for faster computation.

Obsidian is meant to function as a "second brain." This is a specific form of [[Rhetorical Ecology]]: would a person’s writing change based on where they were, or what kind of information they had access to? Obsidian users are keenly aware that the answer is yes.

If a user wanted to take notes "normally"—for example, saving notes to specific folders like "Biology Homework"—Obsidian would have little to offer them over tools like Notepad, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs. Its power is realized when users commit to associative linking and the [[Obsidian Graph View]].
