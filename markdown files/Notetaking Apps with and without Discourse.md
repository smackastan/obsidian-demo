# Notetaking Apps with and without Discourse

Based on [[Swales’ Discourse Community Criteria]] and Gee’s notion of [[Discourse vs discourse]], note-taking apps can be divided into two groups:

- Apps with Discourse communities (e.g., Notion, Goodnotes, Obsidian)
- Apps without Discourse communities (e.g., Google Docs, generic physical notes)

Apps without Discourse lack:

- A strong, identifiable lexis
- Clear mechanisms of intercommunication and shared genres

Apps with Discourse, such as Notion and Goodnotes, have:

- Specialized terms and features
- Active communities (forums, subreddits, discords)

Obsidian is a particularly strict case: its [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] ties membership to heavy commitment to [[Linking and Association]] and [[Local-First Data Ownership]]. There are few "casual" Obsidian users; one tends to be either "in" or "out" of the Discourse.
