# Notion vs Obsidian

Notion is Obsidian’s primary competitor and serves as a foil for the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]]’s values.

## Data Storage and Ownership

Notion made two design decisions notorious in Obsidian’s discourse community:

- Store user notes in the cloud and only the cloud.
- Use a proprietary data format for notes.

Consequences:

- The user does not fully own their notes; they need an internet connection and permission from Notion’s servers.
- Exported data can lose its original structure and may be hard to read outside Notion.

Obsidian, by contrast, stores notes as local Markdown files and exemplifies [[Local-First Data Ownership]].

## Moderation and Access Stories

A popular Reddit post in r/ObsidianMD titled "This is why Obsidian is the best" shows a Notion user having their account banned for content that Notion deemed inappropriate.

- The user lost access to all of their notes.
- When they asked to download their files, they were reminded that their account was terminated.

The top comment reads: "Reading the comments to that post, I found out that Notion basically moderates what you’re allowed or not to write in your PERSONAL NOTES. That’s absolutely crazy ‘1984’ level shit! I’m so happy to be using Obsidian."

By posting and upvoting this, Obsidian users perform their identity:

- They are being members of a community that values [[Local-First Data Ownership]] and [[Individualism and Customization]].
- They define who they are partly by showing who they are not.
