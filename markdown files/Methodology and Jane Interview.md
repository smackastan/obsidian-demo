# Methodology and Jane Interview

Methodology:

- Interview someone who is an avid note-taker and isn’t a member of one particular note-taking Discourse community.
- Take samples of the r/ObsidianMD community from Reddit.
- Analyze as a member of the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]].

## Jane’s Notetaking Practices

My interview participant, who I will call Jane, had tried many different note-taking systems. This helps qualify the overall Discourse in note-taking.

Jane couldn’t choose between Goodnotes, Notion, Google Docs, and physical notes. Notion and Goodnotes are the two note-taking methods that qualify as Discourse communities behind them.

Those who use Google Docs or take physical notes are too dispersed in their community to have their own lexis and proper intercommunication channels, which disqualifies them as discourse communities according to [[Swales’ Discourse Community Criteria]]. Thus, note-taking apps can be divided into two groups:

- Those with Discourse
- Those without Discourse

Notion and Goodnotes, on the other hand, have specific features and terms referring to them that can form a lexis. The new ideas and troubleshooting that takes place on Reddit and their individual forums constitutes proper intercommunication, allowing them to qualify as Discourse communities.

Between the two apps with Discourse, Jane’s identity kit (especially doing and believing) appears to better align with the community of Goodnotes. For all but the Goodnotes community, Jane would be seen as "non-fluent" or a "pretender" (Gee).
