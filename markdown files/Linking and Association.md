# Linking and Association

They choose Obsidian because of its single core feature: its ability to link and connect ideas between notes. This idea may sound confusing at first, but it’s almost entirely the same as the linking functionality in Wikipedia.

For example, the Wikipedia article on the "United States" says that it "is a country primarily located in North America." And the word North America links to another article. This shows that [[Obsidian Users]] make meaning through [[Association as Meaning-Making]] (Downs).

Your brain doesn’t use a filing cabinet to store ideas. It stores ideas through another basic brain operation, association: we make sense of new information by connecting it to (associating it with) known information. Obsidian stores information in the same way—not through a rigid hierarchy, but through simple connections between ideas.
