# Folder-Based Organization vs Wikilinks

This allows Obsidian to organize thousands of notes without any of them being placed in a folder, which happens to be the primary goal of the discourse community.

## Example

I might have taken the following notes that I linked to one other in Obsidian:

- "Stoicism" → "Virtue" → "Resilience" → "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"

These form a tight grouping of ideas.

In a traditional organization structure, I might have created a folder called "Philosophy" before taking notes on stoicism and virtue, and another folder called "Psychology" where I wrote about resilience and CBT. This forcibly separates the ideas for no clear reason even though they flow naturally into one another.

An [[Obsidian Graph View]] would instead display these notes as one tight cluster, based on their links rather than arbitrary folders.
