# Individualism and Customization

Another mythos of the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] is that of individualism and expected freedoms.

Key aspects:

- Obsidian is built for individuals rather than teams.
- It aims to help **Obsidian learn how the user takes notes**, not just teach the user a fixed system.
- This is supported by a large ecosystem of plugins and themes, documented at [[Plugin Development and Customization]].

Even without writing code, users can choose from over 2,500 community plugins to customize their environment. This creates a rhetorical conversation between the product and the user: the user can "respond" to the product by installing or creating plugins.

This aligns with Downs’ idea that "the speaker is inseparable from the audience" and reinforces Obsidian as a reflection of identity.
