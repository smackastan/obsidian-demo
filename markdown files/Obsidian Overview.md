# Obsidian Overview

Obsidian is a specialized note taking software with beta testing starting in May of 2020 and the first official release in October of 2022. The developers estimate that they have accumulated over a million users in that time. The application supports almost every platform. It relies primarily on donations and subscribers of Obsidian Sync, their cloud storage service, to pay for operating costs.

Obsidian’s Discourse community centralizes in Reddit, where r/ObsidianMD has 196K weekly visitors, the Obsidian Forum, which focuses on bugs and practical use cases, and the official Obsidian discord server, with almost every type of discussion and 170k members.
