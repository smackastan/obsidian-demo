# Discourse vs discourse

According to James Gee, there is a crucial difference between a *discourse community* and a *Discourse community*.

- **discourse**: connected stretches of language; text and talk.
- **Discourse**: an entire identity kit, which includes saying, doing, being, valuing, and believing.

By aligning yourself properly in these areas, you have the correct "costume" for how to act within a community. This is what Downs describes as the central, and much more realistic goal of rhetoric (mutual understanding) as opposed to persuasion.

Gee argues that Discourse can’t be directly taught. In the same way that you don’t become a member of Spanish culture in a Spanish language class, you can’t be taught to "fit in" within a community. You do so by doing, being, valuing and believing what they expect you to.

Discourse is also binary: you are either in the Discourse community or you are not and may be a "pretender."
