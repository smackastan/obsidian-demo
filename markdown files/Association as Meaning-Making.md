# Association as Meaning-Making

According to Downs, we make meaning in two different ways: through symbolism and through association. This project primarily focuses on association.

In the context of Obsidian and its users, association means:

- Connecting ideas through wikilinks like [[Linking and Association]]
- Letting structure emerge from these connections instead of pre-defined folders
- Embracing tools like [[Obsidian Graph View]] to see clusters of related notes

Obsidian stores information not through a rigid hierarchy, but through simple connections between ideas, mirroring how the brain makes sense of new information.
