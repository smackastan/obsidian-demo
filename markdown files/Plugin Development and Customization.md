# Plugin Development and Customization

In the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]], plugin development is a central way of saying, doing, and being (Gee).

When a user uploads a plugin, they are:

- Saying they believe their plugin fixes some gap in the program’s capabilities.
- Doing something to solve that problem for themselves and others.
- Being a considerate and contributing member of the community.

Obsidian provides documentation and APIs that allow users to modify the program however they choose, within technical limits. With thousands of published plugins, users can:

- Alter interface and workflows
- Extend core features
- Express their own [[Individualism and Customization]]
