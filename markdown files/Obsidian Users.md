# Obsidian Users

Obsidian’s community has an unusual level of dedication and loyalty. This suggests that it’s not just what tool they use, but who they are.

Obsidian users tend to value:

- [[Association as Meaning-Making]]
- [[Extended Brain Mythos]]
- [[Local-First Data Ownership]]
- [[Individualism and Customization]]

These values shape how they write, how they organize notes, and how they participate in the broader [[Obsidian Discourse Community]].
