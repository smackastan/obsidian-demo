# Obsidian Graph View

An Obsidian graph view displays notes as nodes and wikilinks as edges between them. Notes that are tightly connected form visible clusters.

For example, a chain of notes like:

- Stoicism → Virtue → Resilience → Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

would appear as a tight cluster in the graph. This reflects the principle of [[Association as Meaning-Making]] and supports the [[Extended Brain Mythos]].

The graph is one way the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] sees and performs its values around connection, association, and emergent structure.
