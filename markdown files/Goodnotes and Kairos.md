# Goodnotes and Kairos

For Goodnotes, most influencers Jane watches use it and she hears about it through her classmates. She’s able to communicate with others who use it and follow their practices.

Her usage of Goodnotes has its own degree of kairos and ecology, because on this app she was writing with an Apple Pencil on a tablet. It’s undeniable that you will write different text depending on whether it’s physically written or typed. This is one small part of an ecology of factors that influence the end text.

This observation sets up a comparison to Obsidian: people must also write differently in order to include wikilinks properly. The act of adding [[Linking and Association]] in Obsidian similarly shapes the resulting text.
