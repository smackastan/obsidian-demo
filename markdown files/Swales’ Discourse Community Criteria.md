# Swales’ Discourse Community Criteria

A discourse community is a group of people who share common goals, interests, and ways of communicating.

More specifically, they generally follow eight criteria updated by John Swales in 2016:

1. Goals
2. Intercommunication
3. Mechanisms
4. Genres
5. Lexis
6. Hierarchy/Structure
7. Silential Relations
8. Horizons of Expectation

The [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] can be analyzed using these criteria, especially around shared goals (a scalable note-taking system), specialized lexis ("vaults," "plugins," "graphs," "blocks"), and mechanisms of communication (Reddit, forums, Discord, GitHub).
