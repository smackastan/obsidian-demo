# Local-First Data Ownership

One of the central values of the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] is a commitment to local-first, user-controlled data.

Obsidian stores files in standard Markdown format on the user’s hard drive:

- Markdown is standardized and readable in plain text.
- The user needs no internet connection to create or read notes.

In contrast, [[Notion vs Obsidian]] highlights how Notion:

- Stores user notes in the cloud using a proprietary data format.
- Requires an internet connection and access to Notion’s servers (and terms of service compliance) to retrieve data.

Community stories on r/ObsidianMD about users losing access to their Notion data reinforce and perform this value.
