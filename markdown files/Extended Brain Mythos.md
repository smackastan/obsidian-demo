# Extended Brain Mythos

The **extended brain** mythos is the foundational belief of the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]]. It proposes that cognitive processes extend beyond the brain into tools and environments.

Examples include:

- Counting on fingers
- Offloading memory into calendars, lists, and, in this case, Obsidian notes

In Obsidian, this mythos is enacted through:

- Treating the vault as a "second brain"
- Using heavy [[Linking and Association]] to externalize connections
- Relying on [[Obsidian Graph View]] and search to navigate thousands of notes
