# Rhetorical Ecology

Downs describes rhetoric in terms of **ecology**: meaning is shaped by environments, tools, and relationships, not just isolated speakers and texts.

In this project, rhetorical ecology appears in several ways:

- Jane writes differently when using Goodnotes on a tablet with an Apple Pencil.
- Obsidian users write differently when they expect to create [[Linking and Association]] and see patterns in the [[Obsidian Graph View]].
- The design of tools like [[Notion vs Obsidian]] shapes what is possible and encouraged.

The extended brain mythos of the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] is a specific application of rhetorical ecology.
