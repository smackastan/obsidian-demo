# Strict Membership and Pretenders

This project argues that the [[Obsidian Discourse Community]] operates with a strict in-or-out binary (Gee).

Unlike other apps, Obsidian has few “pretenders”:

- Its central practice of [[Linking and Association]] requires total commitment.
- To be a casual user is to be an outsider, unable to access the Discourse’s full benefits.

This is tied to Gee’s claim that Discourse membership is binary and to Downs’ idea that real rhetorical change happens at the level of identity and ecology rather than simple persuasion.
